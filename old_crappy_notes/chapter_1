Asks user for their name and greets then with it:
---
name = input('enter your name: ')

---

Asks for 2 numbers, stores them and prints their sum:
---
a = int(input('num 1: '))
b = int(input('num 2: '))
print(a + b)
---

Print a multiplication table up to 12:
---
for a in range(1, 12):
    for b in range(1, 12):
        print(a, 'x', b, '=', a * b)
---

Prints the next 20 leap years (n.b. leap year on every date divisible by 4):
---
import datetime
todays_year = datetime.datetime.now().year
next_leap_year = todays_year + 4 - (todays_year % 4)
for i in range(20):
    print(next_leap_year + i * 4)
---

Guessing game:
---
import random
computer_choice = random.randint(1,10)
user_choice = int(input('enter a number: '))
tries = 1
while user_choice != computer_choice:
    if user_choice < computer_choice:
        print('too small!')
    else:
        print('too large!')
    user_choice = int(input('try again: '))
    tries += 1
print('took', tries, 'attempts')
---

Reverse a user's string:
---
def reverse_string(s):
    return s[::-1]
print(reverse_string(input('string to reverse: '))
---

====================

1) Makes code easier to write. Makes code easier to read.
2) A constant does not change its value during the execution of a program; a variable is expected to change.
3) One location to refer to.
4) A value is the actual data stored in a variable. A variable is a "name tag" for a value
5) a) float         | current_vat_rate
   b) datetime      | todays_date
   c) integer       | shop_takings
