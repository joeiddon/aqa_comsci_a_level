Assignment & Sequencing:
---
a = 5
print(a)
---

Selection:
---
a = 5
if a  < 10:
    print('a is less that 10')
else:
    print('a is >= 10')
---

Repetition (& Definite Iteration):
---
for i in range(10):
    print('in this iteration, i is:', i)
---

Indefinite Iteration:
---
a = 1
while a < 10:
    a += 1
---

Nested loops:
---
for i in range(4):
    for j in range(4):
        print(i, j)
