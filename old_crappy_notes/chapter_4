Functions:

def a_plus_b(a, b):
    return a + b
---

a = 5
def what_is_a():

def change_a_to(new_a):
    global a
    new_a = a

N.b. You must use the global keyword to modify a global variable, you can "view" them without this though.

Errors and Exceptions:
---
try:
   a = int(input('numerator: '))
   b = int(input('denominator: '))
   return a / b
except ValueError:
    print('you did not enter integers!')
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print('the denominator was 0!')
