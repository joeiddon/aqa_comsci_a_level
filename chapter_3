End of Chapter Tasks
====================

1)
a, b = 5, 6
print(a + b)
print(a - b)
print(a * b)
print(a / b)
print(a // b)
print(a % b)

2) In some languages (not Python), data type is conserved, so dividing integers will return integers and dividing floats will return floats.
3) The value that a varaible refers to can change - this allows you to use them in an iterative structure where the value will be updated.
4) Truncation (to 3 d.p): int(x * 1000) / 1000
   Rounding   (to 3 d.p): round(x, 3)
5) Random numbers may used for textured graphics, simulation and games.
6) a OR b is false when a is false and b is false
   a XOR b is false when a is false and b is false or a is true and b is true
   e.g. true OR  true == true
        true XOR true == false
7) You can use slicing: 'hello world'[:5] gives 'hello'
8) Strings can be converted to many different formats such as integers, floats and datetime objects.
9) If you know all the parameters to the computer's random function, you can predicte the result so it is not truly random.
